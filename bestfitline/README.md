The problem of ﬁnding a best-ﬁt line to a set of points using Linear Programming. The program, gives a set of points (x1,y1),(x2,y2)...(xn,yn) return the coeﬀeicients a,b such that the line y = ax+b is the best ﬁt line to the points under the least absolute value metric.
Speciﬁcally if the ﬁle input.txt contains  
(0,0),(1,1)  
we can execute  
./bestﬁt.py input.txt and receive the output 
1,0; that is, y = 1·x + 0
