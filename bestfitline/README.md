 Problem 7.8 in the DPV book describes the problem of ﬁnding a best-ﬁt line to a set of points using Linear Programming. In this problem we will ask you to actually implement this as code in python. More speciﬁcally, your program, give a set of points (x1,y1),(x2,y2)...(xn,yn) return the coeﬀeicients a,b such that the line y = ax+b is the best ﬁt line to the points under the least absolute value metric described in DPV 7.8. Your program should use a linear programming library available to you through Python (we suggest scipy.optimize.linprog) though you can use others if you wish.
Speciﬁcally if the ﬁle input.txt contains (0,0),(1,1) we hope to execute ./bestﬁt.py input.txt and receive the output 1,0; that is, y = 1·x + 0
